/**********************************************************
 Colors

 Feel free to change these. We should set up a color pallette. Don't worry about shading we can use scss functions if we need to later on to get the right shade from our palette.

/**********************************************************
 Breakpoints

 We don't have to do it this way, but we can use this to set up the media query breakpoints. I (Lautaro) be doing this with a mixin, but we don't have to do it that way. We can also change this later if we need to since these are just variables.
**********************************************************/
/**********************************************************
 For anyone that has used variables in regular CSS, this is really similar to doing this at the top of a CSS file:

:root {
  --dark: #222;
  --light: #fff;
  --accent1: #efe;
  --accent1: #9fe;
}

**********************************************************/
/**********************************************************
 SCSS Examples, you can definitely delete these.
 Look at the public/css folder to see the calendar.css that is created from this file. Note that the variables are not imported but their values are passed along into the final CSS.

body {
  background: #292929;
